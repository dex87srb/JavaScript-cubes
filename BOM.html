      <h1>JS Browser Object Modeling</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>TASK 1</h2>
        <p>Create a function that will ALERT if browser is online or not.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>TASK 2</h2>
        <p id="reload">
          Create a function that should, when run, reload the page.
        </p>
        <button onclick="reloadPage()">Reload</button>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>TASK 3</h2>
        <p>
          Create a function that should, 3 seconds after page is loaded,
          redirect you to google.com, ad then, 3 seconds after that take you
          back to your page. (Comment out your code once you're done so you can
          continue with the other tasks, as this will cause infinite loop).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>TASK 4</h2>
        <p>
          Create a function that should every second console log a number
          incremented by one. When number reach 15 it should stop running.
        </p>
        <button onclick="intervalNum()">Start</button>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>TASK 5</h2>
        <p id="randomNum">
          Create a function that should return a random number (round number)
          between 0 and 10, every time you run it.
        </p>
        <button onclick="executeRandom(randomNum)">Random Number</button>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>TASK 6</h2>
        <p id="randomNum">
          STEP 1<br />
          Create an array of objects, containing at least 5 users. Each of them
          should have name, age and status. Status should be "inactive" for each
          of them.<br /><br />

          STEP 2<br />
          Once page is loaded it should display a popup where user can enter his
          name. Once it's done name user entered should be compared against
          existing users.<br /><br />

          If it doesn't match any user you should console log message:
          <br /><br />

          "User with name " + name + " doesn't exist."<br /><br />

          If it match some of users, object with that user's data should be
          copied from array. It's status should be changed to "active", and it
          should be saved in local storage using "loggedInUser" as a key.<br /><br />

          STEP 3<br />
          After one minute user's data should be removed from local storage.<br /><br />

          You should console log a message that user is logged out.
        </p>
        <button onclick="question(activeUser,arrayObj)">User</button>
